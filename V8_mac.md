# Fetching, Building and Installing V8 (on MacOS Sierra)

The following instructions fetch the Google V8 JavaScript engine to your local machine and configure it to create static libraries in the location where the RightPeer build system expects to find them.

RightPeer uses V8 version 6.8, and requires at least 4 GB of RAM to build in a reasonable time. It will not build at all with less than 2 GB RAM.

## Clone Google's depot_tools

Google's [depot_tools](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up) are used by the Google build system to manage Git checkouts.

    git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
    cd depot_tools
    git checkout af2ffd933d0e6d8b5bd8c48be7a2b2d568a5eea2
    cd ..
    export PATH=${PATH}:$(pwd)/depot_tools

## Fetch V8

The following commands check out V8 and select the branch used by RightPeer. Please note that this step downloads about 2 GB of data, and can take a long time (30 minutes or more).

    gclient
    fetch v8
    cd v8
    git checkout 6.8.290

## Configure and build V8

The V8 build system currently uses a proprietary version of the Ninja build system, called GN. It is part of the `depot_tools` installed earlier.

    find . -name BUILD.gn -exec sed -i bak '/exe_and_shlib_deps/d' {} \;
    pushd base/trace_event/common
    git checkout 211b3ed9d0481b4caddbee1322321b86a483ca1f
    popd
    RELEASE=out.gn/x64.release
    gn gen $RELEASE --args='is_debug=false target_cpu="x64" v8_static_library=true is_component_build=false use_custom_libcxx=false use_custom_libcxx_for_host=false'

The selected release of the V8 sources requires relaxing two compiler checks to prevent compilation errors.

-   Open the file `build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn` in your favorite editor.

-   Locate the following lines (currently at **1469**):

        if (is_clang) {
          cflags += [
          
-   Add the following two lines to **the end of the block** and save the file:

        "-Wno-defaulted-function-deleted",
        "-Wno-null-pointer-arithmetic",

Build the V8 libraries:

    gn gen $RELEASE
    ninja -C $RELEASE v8 d8

Create an additional library embedding the V8 initial snapshot blobs:

    brew install python@2
    pip install pathlib2
    cd $RELEASE
    python $RIGHTPEER_HOME/depends/v8_data_lib.py
    
### Note

The environment variable `$RIGHTPEER_HOME` should point to the parent of the V8 build folder (see [mac.md](mac.md) for details).
