# Prerequisites

Building Google's V8 on Windows can only be done inside a Windows command prompt (`cmd.exe`), and not in PowerShell or any Unix-like shell (e.g. Cygwin, MSYS, Git Bash, WSL).

It requires the following software:

-   [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15) (community edition acceptable)
-   [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.15/python-2.7.15.amd64.msi)
-   [Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.19.1.windows.1/Git-2.19.1-64-bit.exe)

-   Add the Debugging Tools For Windows:

    -    Control Panel → Programs → Programs and Features → Select the "Windows Software Development Kit" → Change → Change → Check "Debugging Tools For Windows" → Change

The steps described in this document have to be executed in a shell configured for Visual Studio 64 bit (<u>Start</u> / <u>Visual Studio 2017</u> / <u>x64 Native Tools Command Prompt</u>).

# Fetching, Building and Installing V8

The following instructions fetch the Google V8 JavaScript engine to your local machine, configure it to create static libraries, and builds them.

RightPeer uses V8 version 6.8.290, and requires at least 4 GB of RAM to build in a reasonable time. It will not build at all with less than 2 GB RAM.

## Get Google's `depot_tools`

Google's [`depot_tools`](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools) are used to manage Git checkouts and the build system.

-   Download https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra/depot_tools.zip and expand the archive to the current directory.
-   Edit the PATH environment variable and insert the full path of `depot_tools` **before** the installed `python.exe` and `git.exe`.
-   Set the environment variable `DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN=0`.

## Fetch V8

The following commands check out V8 and select the branch used by RightPeer. Please note that this step downloads about 2 GB of data, and can take a long time (30 minutes or more).

    gclient
    
Execute `where python` to ensure that `depot_tools\python.bat` indeed comes *before* `python.exe`

    fetch v8
    cd v8
    git checkout 6.8.290
    pushd base\trace_event\common
    git checkout 211b3ed9d0481b4caddbee1322321b86a483ca1f
    popd

## Configure and build V8

The V8 build system currently uses a proprietary version of the Ninja build system, called GN. It is part of the `depot_tools` installed earlier.

-   Edit the file `BUILD.gn` and remove all lines containing `exe_and_shlib_deps` (8 occurrences)
-   Edit the following files and remove all lines containing `exe_and_shlib_deps`:
    -   BUILD.gn (8 occurrences)
    -   test\cctest\BUILD.gn (2 occurrences)
    -   test\inspector\BUILD.gn (1 occurrence)
    -   test\mkgrokdump\BUILD.gn (1 occurrence)
    -   test\unittests\BUILD.gn (2 occurrences)
        
-   Execute `set RELEASE=out.gn\x64.release`
-   Execute `gn args %RELEASE%`, insert the following content, save and exit Notepad:

            is_debug = false
            target_cpu = "x64"
            v8_static_library = true
            is_component_build = false
            is_clang = false
            v8_enable_object_print = true
            treat_warnings_as_errors = false

-   Execute `ninja -C %RELEASE% v8 d8`
